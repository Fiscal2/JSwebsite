# Rick & Morty JS Site

## Made using the [Rick & Morty API]("https://rickandmortyapi.com/")

## Good JS resources:
- [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
- [JavaScript.com](https://www.javascript.com/resources)

## TODOs: 
- Add a unique favicon to each page.
- Add features to light/dark button on home page.
- Placeholder loading
- Possibly use [Intersection Observer API]("https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API")
- Make a page about the shows creators, details on upcoming season, etc.
    - Make section for streaming services/places to watch it.
    - stats about viewership, etc.
